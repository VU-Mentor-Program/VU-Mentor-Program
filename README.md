ðŸ‘‹ Hi, We're the @VU-Mentor-Program

We're a group of students who host social and academic activities for first year Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Students at the Vrije UniversitÃ¤t Amsterdam.
We encourage students to work together and help each other.
Contribute to the notes repositories for CS and AI if you would like to help out ðŸ˜„.
